The Determination of the Yield According to
R. Wahl’s Method—Continued.

By adding the per cents Balling, viz.: 14.2 to
259, we get 273.2 being the weight of a barrel of 7
wort of 14.2%. This weight multiplied by 14.2 .
gives us 3879.44 and divided by 100 = 38.79 being
the pounds of extraCt per barrel, which multiplied
by the number of barrels in the cellar, viz.: 171, 4
gives us the total extract in this brew, viz.: 6033.84
lbs. By dividing this by the number of pounds 01
material employed, viz.: 7900 —|— 2300 = 110200, we
obtain 65.03 which means per cents of extract and
which is very‘ nearly the same ‘ﬁgure that would be
obtained- by basing the calculation upon the speciﬁc
gravity or by using the Balling table.

The formula has the other advantage that it is
a purely practical one, inasmuch as at every step
we have a clear conception of what we ﬁgure.
By means of the formula given above we can
ascertain:

1. The weight of .a Bbl. of wort of a certain
concentration = 259 + Balling.

2. The aggregate weight of thewort : (259 4“
4- Balling) X Bbls. in the cellar. '

3. The pounds of extract per'Bbl. =
(259 + Bailing) X Balling
100
4. The total amount of extract in a brew _—;
[ (259 + B.) x B. x Bbls. in cellar]
' 100

5. The yield as described above.
