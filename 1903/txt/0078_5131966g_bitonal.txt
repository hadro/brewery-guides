DESIRING THE PATRONAGE OF THE
BREWING- AND MALTING TRADES!

The following FACTS, which conclusively prove that
THE BREWERS’ JOURNAL is the best and most direct
medium for securing the patronage of the brewing and
malting trades, will appeal to your business judgment.

THE JOURNAL, established in 1876, repre—
sents the interests of lager beer and ale brewers
and maltsters, and their employees.

Published in English and German, it 'was in-
corporated in 1890, the majority of the stock
being owned by brewers in the United States.

Its articles on the brewing of lager beer and
ale are original, practical and invaluable; its
news columns faithfully and accurately record
all events, of interest to the trade; its advertising
pages are a directory of reliable houses doing
business with brewers and maltsters.

It has the largest bona ﬁde circulation of any
brewing trade paper in the world, circulating in
all parts of the globe where malt liquors are brewed.

The JOURNAL’S principal ofﬁces are in New
York, Chicago and London, with special corre-
spondents in all the brewing centers throughout
the world. ' .

The General Manager of the company, A. E. J.
TOVEY (an Honorary Member of the United States
Brewers’ Association), is now and has been for
the past twenty years, Secretary of the Brewers’
Association organized in 1830.

Its continuous appointment by the various trade
organizations of lager beer and ale brewers for
the past twenty years, with the verbatim copies of
letters on the opposite page, show its inﬂuence and
the close relations existing between THE BREW-
ERS’ JOURNAL and the brewing and malting

trades and their representative organizations.
