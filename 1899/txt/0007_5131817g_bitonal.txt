 

TOVEY’S OFFICIAL BREWERS’ DIRECTORY,

PREFACE.

IN view of the serious and oppressive burdens
‘ under which the brewing trade is at .present la—
boring, which are made more burdensome by the
intense competition that has long prevailed, and is
still prevalent in the brewing trade, THE BREWERS’
JOURNAL fully recognizes the fact that the publication,
even in classiﬁed form, of the sales of individual
brewers, intensiﬁes this competition. Having due
regard to numerous requests for its discontinuance
from brewers and from State and local organizations
of the trade, and anticipating also a request to the
same effect from the Board of Trustees of the United
States Brewers’ Association, we have resolved to ab-
stain from the publication of these individual sales
of brewers in classiﬁed or any other form.

For a number of years THE BREWERS’ JOURNAL
published, in its annual directory, the precise indi—
vidual sales of every brewer in the country, but in
accordance with expressed wishes of the United States
Brewers’ Association, discontinued the practice and
adopted the system,of classiﬁed sales, which it now
also discontinues in deference to the wishes of its
patrons.

The information furnished in “ TOVEY’S OFFICIAL
BREWERS’ AND MALTSTERS’ DIRECTORY OF THE
UNITED STATES AND CANADA” for 1899, is there-
fore conﬁned to the names and Post Ofﬁce addresses
of all brewers in the United States and Canada, with
the nature of their product; also a list of maltsters
and statistics of the production and sales of malt
liquors in the United States and foreign countries.
