N 0 beer drinker is going to be satis-

ﬁed with sweet, soft drinks, nor with
“near beers” made by chemical compounds.
The same holds good with checked fer-
mentation. The chemical action which
takes place in the consumer’s stomach
makes one bottle his limit.

We take your regular beer, remove the
alcohol, leaving it still a good glass of
beer, marketable anywhere, and under
any law. To do this, we make no change
in your present plant, ‘add no new ma—
chinery, and utilize the equipment you
now have.

We own and Operate under the patents
of Alexander L. Straus, under whose
direct supervision our process is installed
in your plant. With over thirty years as
a practical brewer, and brewery owner,
Mr. Straus’ experience in the making of
non-alcoholic beers is greater than that
of any other man in the trade.

You do not pay us a lump sum before
you start. You pay us a modest royalty
as you go along. The cost of processing
is offset by the excess beer produced.

The business in non— —alcoholic beers is
now tremendous and rapidly increasing.
If the Amendment to the Constitution is
approved, it will be many times as great.

We only want one brewery in your
locality. Can we do business w1th you?
