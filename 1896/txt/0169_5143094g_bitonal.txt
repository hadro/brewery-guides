BREWERS’ GUIDE.

The Determination of the. Yield According to
R. Wahl’s Method.

By adding the degrees Ballmg as indicated by
the saccharometer‘ to 259, multiplying the sum by
the degrees Balling and dividing the product by 100
we obtain a ﬁgure giving the amount of extract in
pounds per barrel of beer. Hence we are in a po-

sition of ﬁguring the yield without reference to any

table by applying the following formula, viz.

[ (259 + Balling)>< Ballinglx bbls. 0f wort in cellar
Pounds of grist.
= yield of extract in per cent.

This formula, which it is easy to remember, will
be especially useful where‘reference to a table can-
not be had. In explanation of the formula we will
say that by adding the degrees Balling to 259 we
:get a ﬁgure which, with almost absolute correct-
"ness, gives the weight of a barrel of wort of the
same saccharometer indication. In this manner
we can dispense with the knowledge of the speciﬁc

gravity of the wort which we do no longer need for ‘

the determination of the extract, 2'. e. the yield.-
Knowing the weight of a barrel. of wort of any con-
centration whatsoever we can thus easily ﬁgure out
the amount of extract per barrel by multiplying the
barrel weight by the per cents Balling and dividing
by 100. \

By, multiplying the pounds of extract per barrel
with the number of barrels in the cellar and divid-
ing the product by the weight of the grist we obtain
the yield in per cents

For instance, a brew resulted in 171 barrels of
14.2% Balling. The material employed was 7,900
lbs. of malt and 2,300 lbs. of grits. What was the
yield?

[(259 +142) X 14-2] X 171 = 65.03%
(7,900 X 2,300)- *
